## Description

Daily Frame is a personal project which includes both a backend and a frontend side. 
The aim of this was to learn the key aspects of creating a full stack app from scratch, using specific frameworks for each side.

The sources of inpiration/learning are many, but mainly from Youtube (for logic) and Instagram/Threads (for designs).

## Characteristics

### Main Page

The main page presents the user all the published posts. However they cannot like a post until they create an account or log in, 
which they can do by one of the buttons in the top right corner.

### Dashboard Page

The dashboard is the main page of the authentificated user. From here they can upload a post, like others posts or modify it's own (delete).

The page keeps the user connected until he logs out, so if you reenter the site the Dashboard Page should open first.
